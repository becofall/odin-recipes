        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>I've made this recipe for years, and it is a favorite at our house. It only
        takes about ten minutes to whip up the dough, and not much longer after 
        that to have a warm cookie in your mouth. And I won't judge if the dough 
        never makes it to the oven!</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 sticks softened butter</li>
            <li>3/4 c sugar</li>
            <li>3/4 c brown sugar</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
            <li>2 1/2 c flour</li>
            <li>1 tsp baking soda</li>
            <li>1 tsp baking powder</li>
            <li>1 tsp salt</li>
            <li>1-2 tbsp corn starch</li>
            <li>1 pkg chocolate chips</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees.</li>
            <li>If butter is cold, soften butter in the microwave.</li>
            <li>Mix butter, and both brown and regular sugar in a mixer.</li>
            <li>Add the eggs and vanilla extract, and mix.</li>
            <li>Add 1 c of flour, the baking soda and powder, salt, and corn starch. Mix.</li>
            <li>Add remaining 1 1/2 c of flour, and mix.</li>
            <li>Stir in chocolate chips.</li>
            <li>Spoon out cookies onto greased baking sheet, and bake in oven for 8 minutes.</li>
            <li>Let cool on baking sheet for a couple minutes, then move to cooling rack.</li>
        </ol>
